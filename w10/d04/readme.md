#### Re-Visiting Front End Libraries and Frameworks

You are going to write a blog post, either on [medium.com](https://medium.com/), wordpress, or any other blogging platform of your choice. We want to you look back at this past week and discuss what you have learned about the different front end frameworks and libraries.  Talk about what you have liked or disliked about them, what you may be interested in learning more about, or maybe you already have a favorite one!  Reflect on these frameworks and submit a github issue in the HW repo with a link to your blog post.
