# Learning about JavaScript Templating

## Part 1
- Take [this short survey](http://goo.gl/forms/d9vrDE4DmO) about whether or not you'd like to work in a group or individually for Project 3 next week. If you choose to work in a group, you will NOT get to choose which group you work in. Groups will be of 3-4 people. Groups will also be required to build a Node.js app, whereas indviduals can work on either a Rails or Node app.
